Official API for the [NIMBUS Voice Assistant](https://github.com/calpoly-csai/CSAI_Voice_Assistant) accessible via HTTP REST protocol.

## ðŸš§ This API is still in-development, so expect the endpoints to be constantly changing until finalized.

## Dev Environment Setup
### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.6.9+ (we're running 3.8 on gce)
2. pip 9.0.1+ (pip 20.1.1 is whats on gce as of this writing, but whatever version you have with your python install is probably fine)
3. git (can you run `git --version`?) (we're using 2.25.1 on gce, but any version will *almost certainly* work)
4. Access to database credentials/api keys (contact us)



### Database Configuration

**Create a file** called `config.json` that should include at least the following details of a MySQL database:
```json
{
    ...
    "mysql": {
        "host": "HOSTNAME",
        "port": "PORT e.g. 3306",
        "user": "USERNAME",
        "password": "PASSWORD",
        "database": "DATABASE",
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

**You can also use [`config_SAMPLE.json`](https://github.com/calpoly-csai/api/blob/dev/config_SAMPLE.json) as a reference (easier!)**

_Contact anyone on the Data Team to get connection details for the Nimbus database_


### Install pip packages
> Note: If you don't have pip installed for python2, you may have to call `pip` instead of `pip3`)

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download spaCy model
There are two spaCy models usable for nimbus predictions.  These are (from [spaCy's docs](https://spacy.io/models)) General-purpose pretrained models to predict named entities, part-of-speech tags and syntactic dependencies. Can be used out-of-the-box and fine-tuned on more specific data.  We use these to classify a question someone asks Nimbus, so we can retrieve an answer from our database.See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57337084/13291759) for an idea of the difference between lg and sm.

```bash
python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```
or 
```bash
python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
```

### Get API keys for terminal instance

```bash
git clone https://github.com/calpoly-csai/nimbus-config-secrets.git

cd nimbus-config-secrets 

source .export_env_vars
```


You should now have everything you need to run the API server.


### Run the API server

```bash
python3 flask_api.py
```
- Opens localhost:PORT
- PORT is changed in gunicorn_config.py

**_Run in the background_**
```bash
python3 flask_api.py&
```

### Run your first API request
```bash
curl --location --request POST 'localhost:8080/ask' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{ "question": "What are the prereqs for CSC 480?" }'
```
- Sends Query to Database through localhost:8080/ask


### Run the tests
```bash
pytest
```
(you may have to run the following if you have python 2.7 installed as well):
```bash
python3 -m pytest
```

### Python PEP8 Style Standards
**_Run the `format` script to automatically make our code look nice_**
```bash
./format.sh
```

_Sometimes the format script is not enough, so run `lint` to manually style our code_
```bash
./lint.sh
```

### Some common issues and solutions
##### ```/bin/bash^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory```:
>Note: This issue can occur (for me, at least) in files other than just format.sh.  These instructions should fix this problem in any file.
```
snekiam@P1:api$ ./format.sh
-bash: ./format.sh: /bin/bash^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
```
This can happen when you're running bash on windows sometimes.  Linux doesn't recognize carriage returns (^M) the same way windows does.  You may have this error in more than one file, but it can be fixed by running `dos2unix` like this:
```
snekiam@P1:api$ dos2unix format.sh
dos2unix: converting file format.sh to Unix format...
snekiam@P1:api$ ./format.sh
(output of format.sh, which can be long so I haven't included it here)
```

## Deployment
### What we use
A Linux server (e.g. Ubuntu 20.04 LTS) with open firewall at `tcp:5000` for _Flask_, `tcp:80` for _http_ and `tcp:443` for _https_ and `tcp:22` for _ssh_ and `tcp:3306` for _mysql_

[See this documentation of the database deployment process](https://github.com/calpoly-csai/wiki/wiki/How-To-Install-and-Set-Up-a-Remote-MySQL-5.7-Database-and-Python-3.6-on-Ubuntu-18.04-with-Google-Cloud-Platform)

We're using docker to deploy - at some point, it'll be easy for you to run the Nimbus API in a local docker container, but at the moment it requires some things (like SSH keys and SSL private keys) which shouldn't be required for a development environment.
